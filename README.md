# 🚗 PlatePatrol – Real-Time Vehicle & License Plate Recognition  
Developed by [Alok Patel](https://github.com/alok2608)

This project is a complete real-time vehicle detection and license plate recognition system, developed using cutting-edge deep learning techniques.

🚘 Built on top of **YOLOv8** for vehicle and plate detection  
🔁 Integrated with the **SORT** algorithm for real-time object tracking  
🔡 Uses **EasyOCR** to read license plates with high accuracy

Whether you're interested in traffic analysis, surveillance, or smart city applications — this project shows how computer vision can be used for real-time video processing and automatic number plate recognition (ANPR).
